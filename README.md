# FirstByte Infrastructure Dashboard

A dashboard for tracking FirstByte club participation, attendance, projects, and engagement.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Prisma ORM, Supabase PostgreSQL  
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui  
- **Deployment:** Vercel

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or 20.x  
- npm (or your preferred package manager)  
- Access to the shared Supabase database (ask a project admin for credentials)

---

## 🔐 Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [REPO_URL]
   cd [REPO_NAME]
   ```

2. **Copy and update environment variables**
   - Create an `.env.local` file
   - Ask Hector or Nick for the Supabase keys
   - Fill in the required values (Will have **two** files)
     ```.env
     DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[URL]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
     ```
     ```.env.local
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://[URL].supabase.co"
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="[ANON_KEY]"
     ```
  - Generate a `CHECKIN_SECRET` for the attendance check-in codes:
    ```bash
    openssl rand -hex 32
    ```
     Add it to `.env.local`. **This is a server-only secret — do NOT prefix it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.** It signs the check-in codes; if it leaks to the browser, anyone could forge attendance codes.
    ```.env.local
     CHECKIN_SECRET="[GENERATED_SECRET]"
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🗄️ Database & Prisma Setup

**Never run `prisma db push` or `prisma migrate dev` on the shared database unless you are coordinating a schema change!**

1. **Generate the Prisma Client**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```
   This creates the client code used by the app to interact with the database.

---

## 🛠️ Starting the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- `"Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL"`  
  - Make sure `.env.local` exists and is filled out  
  - Restart the dev server after any changes

- `"Can't reach database server"`  
  - Confirm your Supabase project is active and credentials are correct  
  - Try using the pooled connection string

- `"Module not found" errors`  
  - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are present

- `"CHECKIN_SECRET is not set"`  
  - The attendance check-in feature needs this variable in `.env.local`  
  - Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`, then restart the dev server

**If you’re stuck:**  
- Check terminal output for error messages  
- Verify your environment variables  
- Contact Ameeka and Nick
